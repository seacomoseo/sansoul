Cookie Policy

**{{% legal name %}}** informs about the use of cookies on its website: **{{% legal web %}}**

## What are cookies?

Cookies are files that can be downloaded to your device through web pages. They are tools that play an essential role in providing numerous information society services. Among other things, they allow a web page to store and retrieve information about a user's or device's browsing habits and, depending on the information obtained, they can be used to recognize the user and improve the service offered.

In general, these technologies can serve very diverse purposes, such as recognizing you as a user, obtaining information about your browsing habits, or personalizing the way content is displayed. The specific uses we make of these technologies are described below.

## Types and Purposes of Cookies

Depending on who manages the domain from which the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, two types can be distinguished:

- **First-party cookies:** those sent to the user's device from a device or domain managed by the publisher itself and from which the service requested by the user is provided.
- **Third-party cookies:** those sent to the user's device from a device or domain not managed by the publisher but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.

If cookies are installed from a device or domain managed by the publisher itself, but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered as first-party cookies.

There is also a second classification according to the length of time they remain stored on the client's browser, which can be:

- **Session cookies:** designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page. They are usually used to store information that is only relevant to provide the service requested by the user on one occasion (e.g., a list of purchased products).
- **Persistent cookies:** the data remains stored on the device and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the cookie's owner, which can range from a few minutes to several years.

Finally, there is another classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the obtained data is processed:

- **Technical cookies:** those that allow the user to navigate through a web page, platform, or application and use the different options or services that exist on it, such as, for example, controlling traffic and data communication, identifying the session, accessing restricted areas, remembering the items that make up an order, processing a purchase order, making a request for registration or participation in an event, using security elements during navigation, storing content for video or sound broadcasting or sharing content via social networks.
- **Personalization cookies:** allow the user to access the service with some general predefined characteristics based on a series of criteria on the user's device, such as language, the type of browser used to access the service, the regional configuration from which the service is accessed, etc.
- **Analysis cookies:** allow the responsible party to monitor and analyze the behavior of users on the websites to which they are linked. The information collected through this type of cookies is used to measure the activity of websites, applications, or platforms and to create navigation profiles of users of these sites, applications, and platforms, with the aim of introducing improvements based on the analysis of usage data by service users.
- **Advertising cookies:** enable the management of advertising spaces in the most effective way possible. We do not use advertising cookies on this website.
- **Behavioral advertising cookies:** store information about user behavior obtained through continuous observation of their browsing habits, allowing the development of a specific profile to display advertising based on this.
