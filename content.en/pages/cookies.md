**{{% legal name %}}** informs about the use of cookies on its website: **{{% legal web %}}**

## What are cookies?

Cookies are files that can be downloaded to your computer through web pages. They are tools that play an essential role in providing many services of the information society. Among other things, they allow a website to store and retrieve information about the browsing habits of a user or their computer, and depending on the information obtained, they can be used to recognize the user and improve the service provided.

In general, these technologies can serve very different purposes, such as recognizing you as a user, obtaining information about your browsing habits, or customizing the way content is displayed. The specific uses we make of these technologies are described below.

## Types and purposes of cookies

Depending on who manages the domain from which the cookies are sent and processes the data obtained, two types can be distinguished:

- **Own cookies:** those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the publisher themselves and from which the service requested by the user is provided.
- **Third-party cookies:** those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the publisher, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.

If cookies are installed from a computer or domain managed by the publisher themselves, but the information collected through them is managed by a third party, they cannot be considered own cookies.

There is also a second classification according to the time period for which they are stored in the browser of the client, which can be:

- **Session cookies:** designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a website. They are usually used to store information that only needs to be preserved for the provision of the service requested by the user on a single occasion (example, a list of products purchased).
- **Persistent cookies:** data continues to be stored on the terminal and can be accessed and processed during a defined period by the cookie responsible, which can range from a few minutes to several years.

Finally, there is another classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the data obtained is processed:

- **Technical cookies:** Those that allow the user to navigate through a web page, platform or application and the use of the different options or services that exist in it, for example, control traffic and data communication, identify the session, access Restricted access parts, remember the elements that integrate an order, carry out the purchase process of an order, make the application for registration or participation in an event, use safety elements during navigation, store content for the dissemination of videos or sound or share content through social networks.
- **Personalization cookies:** those that allow the user to access the service with some predefined general characteristics based on a series of criteria in the user's terminal, such as the language, the type of browser through which the service is accessed, the regional configuration from where the service is accessed, etc.
- **Analysis cookies:** those that allow the person responsible for them to monitor and analyze the behavior of the users of the websites to which they are linked. The information collected through this type of cookie is used in the measurement of the activity of the websites, application or platform and for the elaboration of navigation profiles of the users of said sites, applications and platforms, in order to introduce improvements based on the analysis of the usage data made by the users of the service.
- **Advertising cookies:** those that allow the management, in the most efficient way possible, of the advertising spaces that, where appropriate, the editor has included on a website, application or platform from which the requested service is provided based on criteria such as the content edited or the frequency in which the ads are displayed.
- **Behavioral advertising cookies:** are those that allow the management, in the most efficient way possible, of the advertising spaces that, where appropriate, the editor has included in a website, application or platform from which the requested service is provided. These cookies store information on the behavior of users obtained through the continuous observation of their browsing habits, which allows the development of a specific profile to display advertising based on it.
